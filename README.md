# 👋 Hi, I'm Gautier Petit

🎯 Quant-focused MSc Finance (HEC Lausanne) with expertise in systematic strategies, portfolio optimization, and risk modeling.<br/>
🔬 I build deployable research pipelines that combine finance and machine learning — from clean point-in-time data, through labeling and modeling, to calibrated probability-aware execution.<br/>
🚀 My goal: contribute to hedge fund–style systematic research and portfolio management.<br/>

## 🧠 Current Focus

- 📈 Meta-Labeling Alpha Filter – AI-driven trade signal refinement for systematic equity strategies
- 🧮 Systematic Portfolio Optimization – robust optimization with tail-aware risk measures (CVaR, CDaR, Omega)
- 🤖 Expanding skills in ML/AI for time-series finance (LightGBM, MLPs, calibration, explainability)
- ⚙️ Strengthening C++ for performance-critical quant research environments

## 📌 Featured Project

### [Meta-Labeling Alpha Filter](https://github.com/gautierpetit/meta-labeling-alpha-filter)

>A deployable ML framework that learns when not to trade.
- End-to-end pipeline: point-in-time data → triple-barrier labeling → feature engineering → calibrated ML models (LightGBM, MLP).
- Probability-aware trade gating & sizing with volatility targeting, leverage caps, and turnover controls.
- Results (OOS, net of costs): Sharpe 1.09 in 50/50 blend with SPY; 65.8% win rate across 3,600+ trades.
- 📄 [Full case report included](https://github.com/gautierpetit/meta-labeling-alpha-filter/blob/main/docs/Meta-Labeling%20Alpha%20Filter%20-%20Case%20Report.pdf) | 🐍 Python code | 🔍 Reproducible runs with config snapshots

### [Hedge Fund Portfolio Optimization: A Semi-Parametric Approach](https://github.com/gautierpetit/hedge-fund-portfolio-optimization)

>MSc thesis project on hedge fund allocation.
- Hybrid optimization framework integrating AR-EGARCH volatility, EVT for tails, Student-t copulas for dependencies.
- Objectives: CVaR, CDaR, Omega ratio; non-linear constraints (turnover, correlations).
- Tested on 30+ years of HFR data; outperformed traditional benchmarks in risk-adjusted returns.
- 📄 [Thesis PDF included](https://github.com/gautierpetit/hedge-fund-portfolio-optimization/blob/main/thesis.pdf) | 🐍 Python code | 📊 Full documentation & results
